The model is based on a ResNet18 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, and fine-tuned for this task. It uses Albumentations for data augmentation, and training is done using PyTorch.
Key Features:

	•	Data Augmentation: Enhances generalization using techniques from Albumentations.
	•	Early Stopping: Monitors validation loss to avoid overfitting.
	•	Learning Rate Scheduling: Dynamically adjusts the learning rate for better optimization.
Results

	•	Training Accuracy: 72.24% → 86.05% over 10 epochs.
	•	Validation Accuracy: 76.12% → 85.65%.
	•	Training Loss: 0.764 → 0.403.
	•	Validation Loss: 0.656 → 0.402.

The model shows consistent improvements, with validation accuracy closely following training accuracy, indicating good generalization.
